There are six fundamental concepts of OOPs
- Class
- Objects
- Abstraction
- inheritance
- Encapsulation
- Polymorphism
---
- Objects are instance created using class.
- Each object has their own data and function. Each objects can interact with each other with the help of message pass.
- For interacting, they don't need to have the internal knowledge of each other data and code.
---
- Using inheritance, a child class can inherit the data and code or common properties from the base class.
- inheritance provide code reusablity.
---
- Abstraction include hiding the implemenation detail from the world and showing only the relevant detail to the world.
- It includes hiding something into a function or interface.
---
- Encapsulation includes wrapping up of data and functions into a single unit.
- We can hide this data from the outsidei world using access specifier.
- Encapsulation provides data securit and privacy.
---
- Polymorphism simply means having multiple forms of a same instance.
- They are of two types:
    * Overloading
    * Overriding
- Overloading example: a same function can have multiple forms which act and react differently according to situation.
- Overriding example: a child class can implement function from parent class according to its need.
